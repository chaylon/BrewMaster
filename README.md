# BrewMaster

Welcome to BrewMaster, the app that makes it easy to find and organize your favorite beers and ones you want to try. Users can create lists and add, remove, and rate all the craft beers they can find. If they need inspiration for new beers, users can view other users' lists and search by name, brewery, and type. Users will also receive recommendations based on their highest rated beers. The database is seeded from the Brewery DB API and periodically updates. It features a Ruby on Rails with PosgreSQL backend and a React.js frontend. Join in on the fun at [BrewMaster!](http://brew-master-app.herokuapp.com)
